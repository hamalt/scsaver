Web page screensaver JavaScript library.

## What it is

It is a JavaScript library to realize the function of the screen saver on the web page.  
This program was used in an interactive video for booth installation.  
(I created it because I had to display a different video or image than the interactive video if there was no action.)

## Assumed use case

- Screensaver for interactive video.
- Screensaver for tablet ordering system.
- Screensaver for web-based content.
